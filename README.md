# claude-f-me

**Control intimate hardware by *chatting* in Claude Code.**

An installable [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin that turns natural-language
conversation into real device control — backed by the open
[Buttplug / Intiface](https://buttplug.io) ecosystem (750+ supported toys), with a reactive
bilingual web console, a master remote, and video (funscript), game and audio modes.
A **built-in simulator** lets you build and play with **zero hardware**.

One process is **both** the MCP server Claude talks to **and** the web console you watch —
so the chat and the dashboard always share the exact same device state.

- 🔌 **Real hardware.** Drives Lovense, We-Vibe, Kiiroo, The Handy, Satisfyer, and
  [750+ devices](https://iostindex.com) through [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com).
- 🎼 **Muse mode.** The model *composes* — you describe a vibe ("10-minute tantric slow burn",
  "a thunderstorm", "I love you in morse") and it writes a smooth haptic score and plays it.
  Save scores to a library and replay them. The device becomes an instrument an AI plays.
- 🎭 **Personas.** Pick *who's in control* — driver personalities themed after SOTA models:
  🕯️ Slow Burn (Opus), 😈 Brat (GPT-5.5), 🎼 Metronome, ⛈️ Storm, 🔮 Oracle, 🍼 Mommy. Each changes
  the feel (pace, randomness, denial, ceiling). **Blind mode** hides which one — a mystery in control.
- 💞 **Duet mode.** A room-code link between two consoles over a built-in relay, so a partner's
  input drives your device in real time (mirror / lead / follow), with presence and 👋 touch gestures.
- ⚡ **Reactive "Pulse Core" UI.** A breathing energy orb and an aurora that glow, scale and
  pulse with live intensity, plus a real-time audio waveform — not a boring dashboard.
- 👑 **Master remote.** A phone-friendly page (`/master`) so another person can take control
  in real time — big dial, hold-to-buzz, presets, emergency stop. Every page shows when a master is in control.
- 🎬 **Video mode.** Plays a [Funscript](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/wiki/Funscript)
  timeline in real time (position `0..100` → intensity). One-click built-in sample, **or load a local
  video + script and watch them play in perfect sync** — pause, seek and speed all just work.
- 🔌 **Universal event webhook.** A `POST /event` endpoint so anything — Stream Deck, IFTTT, Home
  Assistant, a game overlay, a CV script — can drive the device (`vibrate`/`pattern`/`game`/`stop`…).
- 📈 **Market mode.** Name a company or ticker (`tesla`, `AAPL`, `bitcoin`) and it polls the live
  quote and plays a **vibration melody** from the move — bigger swing, stronger buzz; green = rising
  arpeggio, red = falling. Possibly the only sex toy that reacts to your portfolio. *(Not financial advice.)*
- 🎮 **Game mode.** `roulette`, `escalation`, `ambient`, `edge` (tease-and-deny) and `wheel` (spin & land),
  plus a `game_event` hook so Claude can react inside a text adventure.
- 🎵 **Audio mode.** Drives the device from your **microphone** or **tab/system audio** in real time.
- 🥁 **Pattern library.** `pulse`, `wave`, `escalate`, `tease`, `heartbeat`, `staircase`, `sos`, `earthquake`.
- 🧠 **Memory.** Local-only memory that learns your favourites, persona affinity and soft dislikes
  (`remember` / `recall` / `forget`) so sessions get more *you* over time — and never leaves your machine.
- 💓 **Biofeedback.** Pair a Bluetooth heart-rate strap/watch (Web Bluetooth, right in the console)
  and let your pulse drive the intensity — or **auto-edge**: when your heart races past the brink it
  cuts to nothing and lets you come back down. A real closed loop with your body.
- 🎬 **Session recording.** Record whatever the device actually does — manual, Duet, audio, bio, games —
  as a Muse score you can name, replay and share. One ⏺ button turns a moment into a keepsake.
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer triggers.** The most "Claude Code plugin" feature there is: drive it from your dev
  loop. A `/dev` endpoint + a built-in 🍅 Pomodoro reward, so CI passing, a commit, a merge or 25
  focused minutes can buzz you. (You can guess what a red build feels like.)
- 📜 **Scene prompts.** Ready-made guided scenes as MCP prompts — mommy scene, edging session,
  story mode, compose-a-vibe, aftercare.
- 💬 **Chat bridges.** Optional **Telegram** bot, **Discord** bot and **WeChat Official Account**
  (公众号) endpoint — control by message or emoji from a chat you already use (long-distance partners).
- 🌐 **Bilingual.** Console and master remote in **English and 中文**, one-tap toggle (or `?lang=zh`).
- 🛟 **Safety, built in.** Global max cap, per-command auto-stop, watchdog, emergency stop everywhere, hardware-off on exit.

## Install (as a Claude Code plugin)

```bash
# 1. add this repo as a plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add mana-am/claude-f-me

# 2. install the plugin
/plugin install claude-f-me@claude-f-me
```

The MCP server (a self-contained bundle, no `node_modules` needed) and the slash commands are
now available. Open a chat and try:

```
scan for devices
vibrate at 40% for 3 seconds
run the "heartbeat" pattern
start an edge game
compose a 5-minute slow build that edges twice then releases
become the Brat persona
surprise me
```

The console comes up at **http://localhost:8731** — run `/claude-f-me:console` to open it.

### Slash commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `/claude-f-me:console` | open the live web console in your browser |
| `/claude-f-me:demo` | run a short scan → vibrate → pattern → game demo |
| `/claude-f-me:fuck` | start the fun (auto-scan, then build up) |
| `/claude-f-me:harder` | turn it up (+20%) |
| `/claude-f-me:softer` | ease off (−20%) |
| `/claude-f-me:edge` | tease-and-deny game |
| `/claude-f-me:tease` | gentle on-off pattern |
| `/claude-f-me:muse` | compose a custom haptic score from a vibe |
| `/claude-f-me:persona` | pick who's in control (Slow Burn / Brat / …) |
| `/claude-f-me:surprise` | pick a random mode |
| `/claude-f-me:safeword` · `/claude-f-me:panic` | **stop everything immediately** |

## 🚀 Getting started — step by step

### 0. Prerequisites
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** to use it as a plugin — or just **Node ≥ 18** for the standalone console.
- A **browser** (Chrome/Edge recommended; the mic and heart-rate features need a modern browser).
- **Hardware is optional** — the built-in **simulator** runs everything with nothing plugged in.

### 1. Install

**A) As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add mana-am/claude-f-me
/plugin install claude-f-me@claude-f-me
```

The MCP server is a self-contained bundle — no `node_modules`, no build. (Repo private? Make sure your
GitHub account has access, or use the from-source path below.)

**B) Standalone / from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mana-am/claude-f-me
cd claude-f-me
npm install
npm run build
npm run console                                   # console only, no Claude needed
# …or register the built server with Claude Code manually:
claude mcp add claude-f-me -- node "$(pwd)/dist/index.js"
```

### 2. First run (no hardware)
1. Open the console at **http://localhost:8731** (or run `/claude-f-me:console`).
2. Click **Scan** → two **simulated** devices appear.
3. Drag the orb / scrubber and watch it glow & pulse. Try a **pattern** chip (heartbeat, edge…) and a **game**.
4. Hit the red **STOP** any time (or press `space`). Keyboard: `0–9` set level, `S` scan.

### 3. Drive it from Claude
In a Claude Code chat, just talk:

```
scan for devices
vibrate at 30% for 5 seconds
run the heartbeat pattern
start an edge game, then stop after a minute
become the mommy persona and compose a gentle 3-minute build
```

…or use the slash commands: `/claude-f-me:fuck`, `:edge`, `:harder`, `:softer`, `:surprise`, `:safeword`.

### 4. Connect a real device (optional)
Install Intiface, pair your toy, set `CFM_MODE=buttplug` — full steps just below.

### 5. Go further (all optional)
- 👑 **Hand someone the remote** — open `/master` (or the 👑 Remote button) and share it over a tunnel.
- 💬 **Control from chat** — set `CFM_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` / `CFM_DISCORD_TOKEN` ([Chat bridges](#-chat-bridges--telegram)).
- 🎼 **Let a model compose (Muse)** — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, but read [rate-limit etiquette](#️-respecting-model--agent-rate-limits) first.

## Connect a real device

claude-f-me is built for real hardware first; the simulator is just a preview.

1. Install and open **[Intiface Central](https://intiface.com)** → press **Start Server**
   (default `ws://127.0.0.1:12345`).
2. Pair your toy in Intiface and confirm it appears. Lovense is the easiest to buy and best
   supported; almost anything on the [device list](https://iostindex.com) works.
3. Set **`CFM_MODE=buttplug`** (edit the `env` block in [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json), or export it standalone).

> The plugin ships defaulting to `simulated` so it runs out of the box. Node 22+ has a global
> `WebSocket`; on older Node, claude-f-me polyfills it from `ws`, so real-hardware mode works on Node 18+.

### No hardware yet? Preview mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mana-am/claude-f-me
cd claude-f-me && npm install && npm run build
npm run console        # open http://localhost:8731
```

Hit **Scan**, drag the orb, fire patterns/games, load the sample funscript, enable **Audio**,
and mash **STOP** — the simulated motor reacts on screen. Keyboard: `0–9` set level, `space` stop, `S` scan.

## 👑 Master remote

Open the console and click **👑 Remote** (or browse to `/master`). A focused phone-sized remote —
big dial, hold-to-buzz, pattern/game shortcuts, safety cap, full-width stop. Anyone holding it is
counted as a **master**, and every page shows `👑 N master in control`.

To hand the remote to someone **not on your machine**, expose the console port over a tunnel
(e.g. `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8731` or `ngrok http 8731`) and share the `/master`
link. Over a tunnel it's HTTPS, so `wss://` works automatically.

> Only ever hand control to someone the wearer trusts and consents to. The safety cap and the
> wearer's own STOP always win.

## Modes & games

**🎼 Muse (composed scores)** — the model turns a natural-language brief into a smooth keyframe
timeline (`{at, level}`, interpolated) and plays it. Composed in chat with the `compose` tool, or
from the console's **"describe a vibe"** box when an external model key is set. Scores can be
saved to a library (built-ins included) and replayed with `muse_list` / `muse_play`.

**🎭 Personas** — a driver personality that modulates every game/event (pace, randomness, denial,
ceiling) and, with a matching key, picks which model composes your Muse scores:
🕯️ `slowburn` (Opus) · 😈 `brat` (GPT-5.5) · 🎼 `metronome` · ⛈️ `storm` · 🔮 `oracle` · 🍼 `mommy`.
`set_persona blind` hides the choice until `reveal_persona`.

**💞 Duet** — open the console's **Duet** panel, share a relay URL + room code, and two consoles
link through the built-in `/relay` hub. Pick **mirror** (both feel each other), **lead** (you drive)
or **follow** (you receive); send a 👋 touch. Incoming levels still pass your local safety cap.

**🎬 Video (funscript)** — plays a `{at,pos}` timeline, interpolated to intensity in real time
(`loop`, `speed`, `invert`). Use the **Load sample** button to try it with no file. Or open the
**🎬 Funscript** dialog, paste/load a script, pick a **local video file** and hit **▶ Play with
video** — the browser plays the video and drives the device from `video.currentTime`, so pause,
seek and playback speed stay perfectly in sync (nothing is uploaded; it's all local).

**🎮 Games** — `roulette` (random bursts) · `escalation` (ramp & hold) · `ambient` (organic waves) ·
`edge` (ramp to the brink, deny, peak creeps up) · `wheel` (spin through levels, land & hold).

**🥁 Patterns** — `pulse` · `wave` · `escalate` · `tease` · `heartbeat` · `staircase` · `sos` · `earthquake`.

**🎵 Audio** — mic or tab/system audio drives intensity by loudness, with a sensitivity slider.

**💓 Biofeedback (heart rate)** — click **💓 Heart rate** in the console to pair a standard
Bluetooth HR strap/watch (Web Bluetooth — Chrome/Edge over `localhost` or HTTPS). The range
auto-calibrates, then **follow** maps your pulse to intensity, or **auto-edge** cuts to nothing
whenever your heart races past the brink and resumes as you settle. A real closed loop.

**🎬 Session recording** — hit **⏺ Record** to capture whatever the device does (from any driver —
slider, Duet, audio, bio, games) as a Muse score; name it on stop and it lands in your library to
replay or share. (Recordings under ~1s are dropped.)

## 💓🎬🧑‍💻 Body, recordings & dev triggers

**Biofeedback** and **session recording** live in the console (above) — both need a browser
(Bluetooth, capture). **Developer triggers** drive the device from your dev loop via a tiny
local endpoint — see [Developer triggers](#-developer-triggers).

## 🧠 Memory

Optional local memory so claude-f-me **gets to know you**. It records which games and Muse scores
you reach for, which persona you vibe with, and **soft dislike signals** (things stopped seconds
after they started), plus any free-form notes. Claude can `recall` it before composing or escalating,
and `forget` wipes it.

- Tools: `remember "loves heartbeat at 60%"` · `recall` · `forget`
- Stored at `~/.claude-f-me/memory.json` — **local only, never transmitted**, plain JSON you can read or delete.

## 📜 Scene prompts

Guided scenes ship as **MCP prompts** — run them from Claude Code as `/mcp__claude-f-me__<name>`:

| prompt | what it sets up |
|---|---|
| `mommy-scene` | roleplay the 🍼 Mommy persona while driving the device |
| `edge-session` | a structured tease-and-deny session with check-ins |
| `story-mode` | an interactive text adventure where choices drive the device |
| `compose-vibe` | turn a description into a Muse score and play it |
| `aftercare` | a gentle, soothing wind-down |

## 💬 Chat bridges — Telegram

Control from a chat app you already use — perfect for a long-distance partner. Set a bot token and
the bridge starts automatically:

```bash
# from @BotFather; allow-list the chat ids that may control it (strongly recommended)
export CFM_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456:ABC...
export CFM_TELEGRAM_ALLOW=11111111,22222222
```

Then message the bot: a number `0–100`, `harder` / `softer`, `stop` / `safeword`, `scan`, or an emoji —
🔥 edge · 💓 heartbeat · 🌊 ambient · 🎡 wheel · 📈 escalation · 🎲 surprise · 🛑 stop. Replies are
bilingual (auto-detects Chinese). Without an allow-list, anyone who finds the bot can control it —
so set one. The safety cap and `safeword` always win.

## 💬 Chat bridges — Discord

A Discord bot (minimal Gateway client, no `discord.js` dependency) — DM it or use it in a channel.

```bash
# bot token from the Developer Portal → Bot (enable the "Message Content Intent")
export CFM_DISCORD_TOKEN=...
export CFM_DISCORD_ALLOW=<your-user-id>,<channel-id>   # allow-list (set this!)
```

Same vocabulary as Telegram: `0–100`, `harder`/`softer`, `stop`/`safeword`, `scan`, or 🔥💓🌊🎡📈🎲.
It stays quiet on unrelated chatter and ignores its own / other bots' messages.

## 💬 Chat bridges — WeChat (公众号)

Two-way control from WeChat **the compliant way** — via an official **Official Account (公众号)**
message callback. We deliberately avoid personal-WeChat web protocols (itchat/wechaty): those break
WeChat's ToS and get accounts banned.

```bash
export CFM_WECHAT_TOKEN=the_token_you_set_in_公众号后台
export CFM_WECHAT_ALLOW=openid1,openid2   # optional: restrict who can drive, by OpenID
```

Then in **公众号后台 → 设置与开发 → 基本配置 → 服务器配置**, point the URL at
`https://<your-public-host>/wechat` (this runs locally, so use a tunnel/反向代理 like cloudflared).
The endpoint handles the GET signature handshake and replies to text/emoji messages passively
(`0–100`, `harder`/`softer`, `stop`, `扫描`, 🔥💓🌊🎡📈🎲); a voice note returns a heartbeat buzz.

> **Personal WeChat** still has no official bot API — don't use grey web protocols. For
> send-only/team alerts, **企业微信 group-robot webhooks** are simpler but can't receive replies;
> the 公众号 path above is what enables two-way control.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer triggers

Drive the device from your dev loop — a local HTTP endpoint at `/dev` that a git hook, CI step,
Pomodoro or shell alias can hit. Events map to reactions (all still pass the safety cap):
`commit`/`push` → pulse · `ci_pass`/`merge`/`focus_done` → reward 🎉 · `ci_fail` → SOS buzz ·
`distracted` → stop. Set `CFM_DEV_SECRET` to require `secret=` if the port isn't localhost-only.

```bash
# one-off
curl -fsS localhost:8731/dev -d event=ci_pass

# git: .git/hooks/post-commit  (chmod +x)
curl -fsS localhost:8731/dev -d 'event=commit&magnitude=0.5' >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

# GitHub Actions (reach your machine via a tunnel; gate with a secret)
- run: curl -fsS "$CFM_URL/dev" -d "event=ci_pass&secret=$CFM_DEV_SECRET" || true
```

The console also has a built-in **🍅 Focus 25m** Pomodoro that fires `focus_done` (a reward) when
the timer completes.

## 🔌 Universal event webhook

One endpoint the whole world can poke — point a Stream Deck button, an IFTTT / Home Assistant
automation, a Tasker task, a game overlay or a computer-vision script at `POST /event`:

```bash
curl -fsS localhost:8731/event -d 'action=vibrate&intensity=0.6&duration_ms=3000'
curl -fsS localhost:8731/event -d 'action=pattern&name=heartbeat'
curl -fsS localhost:8731/event -d 'action=game&type=edge'
curl -fsS localhost:8731/event -d 'action=event&kind=reward&magnitude=0.8'
curl -fsS localhost:8731/event -d 'action=stop'
```

Actions: `vibrate` (`intensity`, `duration_ms`) · `pattern` (`name`, `loops`) · `game` (`type`) ·
`event` (`kind` reward/penalty/tease/pulse, `magnitude`) · `stop` · `scan`. Optional shared secret
`CFM_EVENT_SECRET` (falls back to `CFM_DEV_SECRET`). Everything still passes the safety cap.

## 📈 Market mode

Feel the market. Name a company or ticker and it polls a live quote (Yahoo Finance → Stooq →
Coinbase fallback, no API key) and plays a vibration melody from the intraday move: magnitude scales
with the size of the swing, a green day plays a **rising** arpeggio and a red day a **falling** one.

- In chat: `market_mode` with `symbol` (`tesla` / `AAPL` / `bitcoin` / `BTC-USD`), optional
  `interval_ms` (min 5000), `duration_ms`, `intensity_max`. `stop_mode` / `emergency_stop` end it.
- In the console: type a ticker in the **📈 Market** box and hit **Feel it**.
- Friendly names (apple/tesla/nvidia/bitcoin/… incl. 中文) resolve to tickers automatically.

> Polls on your machine, respects the safety cap, and runs no faster than every 5s. Not financial advice.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # MCP + console, watch mode (tsx)
npm run build        # type-check + emit dist/ (tsc)
npm run bundle       # self-contained dist/claude-f-me.mjs for the plugin (esbuild)
```

## ⏱️ Respecting model & agent rate limits

Anything that touches **Claude / Codex / OpenAI** is built to be a polite citizen of your **weekly
and daily usage limits** — never indulgent:

- **Muse composition is on-demand only** — never looped or polled. A minimum gap is enforced between
  compose calls, and on HTTP **429** it backs off once (honouring `Retry-After`) then fails cleanly
  with a "wait a bit" message instead of hammering the API.
- **Pet mode (roadmap) will cost zero quota by design.** It reads your coding agent's *local output
  stream* (tokens/sec) to set intensity — it will **not** call any model API itself.
- **Developer triggers & webhooks** react to events *you* send; they generate no model traffic.
- Bring-your-own keys are read from the environment, used only when you explicitly compose, and
  **never written to disk**. With no key, Muse just asks the Claude you're already chatting with.

> Rule of thumb: claude-f-me should never be the reason you hit a model limit. If you get close, it
> backs off and tells you — it will not keep retrying.

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

- **Console won't open / "port in use".** Another instance holds `8731` — stop it
  (`lsof -ti tcp:8731 | xargs kill`) or set `CFM_CONSOLE_PORT` to a free port.
- **"No devices" after Scan (real hardware).** Ensure Intiface Central is running with **Start Server**
  pressed, your toy is paired there, and `CFM_MODE=buttplug` is set. The simulator always shows devices.
- **Microphone / heart-rate won't start.** Browsers only allow them on a secure context — use
  `http://localhost` (treated as secure) or serve over HTTPS (a tunnel works), in Chrome/Edge.
- **Plugin won't install.** The repo is private — make sure your GitHub login has access, or use the
  from-source path.
- **"composing too fast".** That's the rate-limit guard — wait a few seconds.
- **Orb moves but nothing buzzes.** You're in `simulated` mode (the default) — switch to `buttplug` for real hardware.

## ❓ FAQ

**Do I need to buy hardware to try it?** No. The built-in **simulator** is the default — scan,
patterns, games, Muse, audio and the whole UI work with nothing plugged in.

**Which device should I buy?** Anything on the [Buttplug device list](https://iostindex.com) works.
**Lovense** is the easiest to find and the best supported; We-Vibe, Kiiroo, The Handy and Satisfyer
are all solid.

**Which OS does it run on?** macOS, Windows and Linux — it's just Node ≥ 18. Real hardware goes
through **Intiface Central**, which is cross-platform. The mic / heart-rate features need a
Chromium browser (Chrome/Edge) on `localhost` or HTTPS.

**Is my data sent anywhere?** No. See [Privacy](#-privacy) — memory is local-only, keys are never
written to disk, and there's no telemetry. The only outbound traffic is hardware control (local),
optional Muse composition (only when *you* compose, to your own key), and Market mode quotes.

**Do I need an API key?** No. Muse works by asking the Claude you're already chatting with. A key is
only needed for the console's "describe a vibe" box to compose without Claude in the loop.

**The plugin won't install.** The repo is private — make sure your GitHub login has access, or use
the [from-source path](#1-install).

## 🔒 Privacy

Privacy is a feature here, not an afterthought:

- **Memory is local-only.** It lives at `~/.claude-f-me/memory.json` as plain JSON you can read,
  edit or delete — **it is never transmitted**. `forget` wipes it.
- **Keys never touch disk.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` are read from the environment
  and used only when you explicitly compose. Duet's relay is keyless.
- **No telemetry.** Nothing about your usage is logged or phoned home. The console and device state
  stay on your machine; Duet and the master remote only move data between consoles *you* connect.
- **You own the network surface.** Bridges and webhooks are opt-in, off by default, and gated by
  allow-lists / shared secrets. Expose a port only when you choose to (and prefer a tunnel + secret).

## 🛟 Safety & consent

This is intimate hardware on a real body. The design reflects that, but **you** are the last line of defense:

- A **global max-intensity cap** clamps everything (tool, console slider, master remote).
- Every `vibrate` arms an **auto-stop**; even with no `duration_ms` there's a hard 5-minute ceiling,
  and continuous drivers (patterns/video/game/audio) have a watchdog that stops the motor within seconds.
- `emergency_stop` / `/claude-f-me:safeword` / the red console button / the master's STOP halt everything instantly.
- Hardware is turned off when the process exits.

Only ever use this with informed, enthusiastic, revocable consent. Don't log or transmit usage data.
You are responsible for how you use it.

## Roadmap / ideas

Where this is headed — PRs and opinions welcome:

- 🏆 **Leaderboards, achievements & challenges.** Personal stats (sessions, total time, **longest edge
  held**, best streaks), unlockable achievements, and **opt-in, anonymous** community boards + daily/
  weekly challenges (e.g. "survive a 5-minute edge"). Couple streaks for long-distance partners.
  Privacy-first: opt-in only, no content, anonymous handles.
- 🌍 **Public control mode.** A shareable public room (the master remote, opened to many) where an
  audience or a stream chat collectively drives the device — cam-style "tip / vote to control",
  a live crowd dial, queued turns. With hard guard-rails: a low forced cap, a host **kick / pause /
  lock**, per-viewer cooldowns, an always-on safeword, and a one-tap "go private". Consent and
  moderation first — public means *the wearer opted in*, and can revoke instantly.
- 🧩 **Share scores & patterns.** Export/import Muse scores and funscripts by a short code — a little
  community library of vibes.
- 🗣️ **Persona voice.** Optional TTS so the persona actually *speaks* its lines (🍼 "good girl…").
- 🎮 **Game & stream integration.** React to events in games or streams (a death, a win, a donation).
- 🐾 **Pet mode (agent throughput).** Hook a coding agent — **Codex** or Claude Code — and let its
  *live output rate* drive intensity: tokens flying = turned up, a stall or a red build = it drops.
  Productivity as a reward loop. Extends 🧑‍💻 Developer triggers from discrete events to a continuous
  signal (tail the agent's stream → tokens/sec → intensity, through the safety cap of course).
- 🔐 **Encrypted, PIN-locked memory.** Lock the local memory and console behind a code.
- 🧠 **Memory → behaviour.** Today memory *records* and Claude can *recall* it; next, let it
  automatically steer persona/Muse choices and avoid disliked combos without being asked.
- 💬 **More chat bridges.** Telegram, Discord and WeChat 公众号 already ship — next up: **Slack**
  and **WhatsApp** via the Business API. (**Personal WeChat** has no official bot API, only grey
  protocols that break ToS and get accounts banned, so only the 公众号 path is supported; 企业微信
  (WeCom) send-only robots are possible but clunky.)
- 🖥️ **Console panels** for the memory profile, persona picker and Muse library (today they're
  tool/chat-driven).
- 👩 **"Boss-key" discretion mode.** A hotkey that instantly silences + disguises the console as
  something innocent when someone walks in (separate from the 🍼 Mommy *persona*).
- ⏰ **Scheduled teases.** "Good morning" sessions and timed surprises.
- 🎲 **Group play.** A shared room where several people collectively control one device (a real
  wheel-of-fortune).
- 🗣️ **Voice notes → audio mode.** Drive intensity from a sent voice message, not just a live mic.
